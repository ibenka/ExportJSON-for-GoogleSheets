# ExportJSON-for-GoogleSheets

##### JSON exporter for GoogleSheets. Based on https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/1878143

##### Usage:

* Paste the code from exportjson.js to the Code.gs in your spreadsheet: **Tools - Script Editor**, save it. Reload your spreadsheet. You should be able to see a new button in the tools panel.
* Freeze your first row: **View - Freeze - 1 row**
* Press that new button from step 1 (it will ask for autorization and permission, allow it).

Note: if you add "**TEST_**" to the header's name or sheet's name, it won't be exported.
